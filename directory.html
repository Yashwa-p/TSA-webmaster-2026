          <h3>Forgotten Cats, Inc</h3>
          <p>"Founded in 2003, Forgotten Cats, Inc. is the leading trap, neuter, vaccinate, return (TNVR) nonprofit in the region. Servicing Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New Jersey, Forgotten Cats specializes in TNVR in order to humanely reduce the homeless cat population. Valuing all lives, Forgotten Cats is a no-kill organization. Forgotten Cats’s TNVR services involve working with colony caregivers to identify all cats within a colony, after which we trap, transport, sterilize, vaccinate, recuperate, and return feral cats to caregivers. Our goal is to stabilize each colony and ensure zero population growth. We achieve this by trapping and sterilizing every single cat in the entire colony. About 20 percent of the cats that enter our clinics each year are not feral. Stray cats, or homeless domesticated cats, and feral kittens under 12 weeks old, are held and placed into our adoption network. "</p>
